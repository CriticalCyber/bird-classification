## 🐦 Bird Classification Project

Welcome to the Bird Classification project! This repository showcases a machine learning model designed to accurately identify different species of birds based on image input. Whether you're a bird enthusiast, a machine learning student, or just someone curious about how deep learning models recognize patterns, this project has something for you!

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying three common birds: sparrows, pigeons, and crows. It leverages deep learning techniques to train and deploy a model capable of identifying these birds using image data.

## 🧠 How It Works
The core of the project is built using Python and leverages TensorFlow or Keras (based on the model.py implementation).

A dataset of bird images is used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The model predicts the bird species and returns the classification result along with the class confidence.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Classifies sparrow, pigeon, and crow images

✅ Lightweight and easy-to-run model

✅ Simple web interface to upload and classify bird images

✅ Modular code with model.py for logic and web.py for the web app
